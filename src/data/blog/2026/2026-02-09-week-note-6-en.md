Feb 2–8, 2026

I got an InBody scan, and compared to last month, my body fat and weight went down while muscle mass increased slightly. I'm riding good momentum right now, so with a bit more effort, I think I can keep losing fat and gaining muscle in the direction I want. I was in such a good mood that I treated myself to a nice meal as a reward.

This week, I had my regular hospital check-up and manual therapy session. The doctor said that from the outside, the bone now appears to be fused. It still needs more time to fully heal internally, but at least I'm not in a situation where I'd need another surgery. The pain in my upper left arm is gone and the muscle tightness has eased significantly, but the elbow pain persists. Sometimes I hear a sound from the bone when bending or extending my arm, and during workouts, it feels like my arm doesn't fully extend. Since the elbow was dislocated once and a tendon was torn, the doctor said the pain could last several more months. Fortunately, the manual therapy session helped ease the elbow pain quite a bit.

I've been developing and testing features for the new app version. It's time to prepare and ship the update. Since it's an app I actually use, I've been testing with real data to catch anything unusual. There are more details to check carefully than I expected, so it takes time, but I'm working through them one by one. Lately, I've been sharing my progress on social media. (#BuildInPublic) I decided that casually sharing my work process on social media is a better long-term investment than posting on Reddit and building up karma through comments. I'm not posting daily, but whenever something reaches a certain level of completion, I tease the upcoming version.

Spring is starting to show its first signs. Like sprouts rising through the soil after a cold winter, warmed by gentle sunlight, I hope my own season of bearing fruit is arriving too—after enduring through the cold. Maybe it's already starting to show.
