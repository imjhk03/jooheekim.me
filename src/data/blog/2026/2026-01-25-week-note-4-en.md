Jan 19–25, 2026

This week was a bit emotionally tough.

My left arm fracture still hasn't fully healed. The vertical crack is gradually fading as new bone tissue forms, but the bone fragment that juts out below still has a long way to go. The joint area is recovering quickly, but the bone shaft needs more time. They say I should expect a full year for complete recovery after surgery. Rotation still feels awkward, and my range of motion isn't fully restored. If I stop physical therapy now, I'll plateau at about 90% recovery. I don't want that, so I'm continuing treatment—but the slow progress is making me a bit impatient.

This was my first time handling administrative tasks since becoming a freelancer. It felt overwhelming at first, but after a few days of research, I managed to get through it. Once I actually faced it, it wasn't as bad as I'd feared. When I was an employee, I never had to worry about these things. Going independent has made me realize how much there is to learn. Still, I'm not ready to give up yet.

This week I couldn't find any personal time because I was focused on contract work. It involved photo and video features I'd never worked with before, so I had to deal with unfamiliar technologies. Fortunately, I was able to fix bugs effectively using Claude Code. Without AI, I would have spent much longer digging through documentation and tutorials. At first, even when I explained bugs in detail, they weren't always resolved properly. But when I started over with fresh explanations and delegated specific tasks to agents, fixes became much smoother. The project I'm working on would normally require a team of about four people, but I'm handling it alone with Claude Code. I've been creating specialized agents for different areas and working according to the development process. It's starting to stabilize now. I should write a separate post later about my Claude Code setup and development workflow.

Despite the challenges, there were good moments too. A postcard that my friend living in the UK sent in early December last year finally arrived. On my way home from working at a cafe, I ran into my dad and we went through a Burger King drive-through together for the first time in a while. I also received an inquiry about using a photo I took a while back. And the iPhone 17 Pro that my sibling bought in the US made its way to me.

Looking in the mirror after a while, I noticed a lot of gray hairs have grown in. Tomorrow I'll dye my hair and take some time to care for myself.
