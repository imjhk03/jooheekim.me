Jan 26–Feb 1, 2026

They say routines keep you going. For me, that's really true—routines help me get through days when I'm feeling down or when things aren't going well. My favorite routine is exercising on Monday mornings. Starting the week with a workout gives me a sense of accomplishment. I try to exercise in the morning and soak up some sunlight in the afternoon. I've designated Wednesday as my outing day, when I run errands or work from a favorite cafe with coffee and my laptop. These routines make me feel alive. When things get tough and my mind feels unsettled, they help me get back on my feet.

This week, I didn't have much contract work to revise, so I could focus on my own project. I finally set up the development environment I'd been putting off, though it took longer than expected. Beyond just configuring the project, I also customized Claude Code to match my preferred workflow. Since I'm developing solo, I wanted Claude Code to feel like a pair programming partner. I also added Codex for PR reviews. After setting everything up, it felt like I'd tidied up my workspace. Thanks to that, I was able to develop several features.

The contract work is almost wrapped up for the new version—now I just need to use it myself to find any remaining bugs or issues. There's a feature I unexpectedly like, and I've been using it often. App development really is more fun when you're building something you'll actually use regularly.

This month feels like it's going to be strangely busy. A new app update is scheduled for release, and there's Lunar New Year plus several family events. Still, I'll try to stick to my routines as much as possible. After all, routines keep me going.
