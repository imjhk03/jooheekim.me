Jan 12–18, 2026

There are many ways to improve quality of life. Spending on self-care, enjoying good food—things like that. But among them, the ones I'm most satisfied with are my Kagi Search and YouTube Premium subscriptions. Kagi Search filters out sites I don't want to see and only shows me results I need. It blocks sites like Namu Wiki or DC Inside and surfaces trustworthy sites at the top. As for YouTube Premium, I subscribed because I didn't want to see ads. Some might think, "Can't you just wait through those short ads?" But no—it removes unnecessary things I don't have to think about. If Instagram ever releases an ad-free subscription, I'd subscribe immediately. That's the same reason I pay for the ridiculously expensive X (Twitter) ad-free subscription: to see fewer harmful ads. Though I can't recommend Twitter's subscription in good conscience—it's just too expensive.

They say it takes three weeks to form a habit. I used to wear my watch on my right wrist, but now I'm wearing it on my left again. Still, when I habitually go to check the time, I raise my right arm, or when putting the watch back on, I instinctively reach for my right wrist. I need another three weeks. When I try to look at my right wrist for the time, it still feels awkward—a sign that my range of motion hasn't fully recovered yet.

Since getting injured, I've become more aware of my body's reactions. For example, when running, my left arm feels the impact and vibrations more acutely. These days, I often catch myself thinking, "If I push just a little more, it'll be too much." Even when I think, "It's just one more thing, I could probably do it," my brain keeps hitting the brakes. I think it's my mind being overly cautious—afraid that pushing too hard could backfire. Thanks to that, I'm trying to slow down, but part of me still wants to do more.

This week I had some time to work alone, and I worked hard through Friday. Using Claude Code Max meant I could work quickly without hitting usage limits. The project wasn't something I was familiar with, so I approached it by learning as I worked. By setting the output style to "explanatory," I gradually deepened my understanding of the project through each insight. To improve efficiency, I also instructed Claude to create two agents to work on tasks. Claude Code reads the project code, but sometimes it doesn't read deeply enough and misses things. When working on UI, things that were working fine would suddenly break layouts. Once those issues started piling up, I instructed it to create a minimal number of agents to help with tasks. That helped reduce the number of missed items significantly.

I've nearly finished the major work. Now I need to proceed with the remaining tasks one by one. I'm a little anxious, but I have to get it done. If I want to wrap up January comfortably, I need to push through. Let's go.
