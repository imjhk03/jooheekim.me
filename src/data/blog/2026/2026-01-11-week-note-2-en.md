Jan 5–11, 2026

About three months after my left arm surgery, I started PT again. My doctor said I could do lower-body training and very limited upper-body work, so I jumped right in and rebuilt a routine. To kick off the year, I also did an InBody check. After about three months of reduced activity—and eating more than usual—my muscle mass had gone down and my body fat had increased a lot. Seeing a “above standard” number for the first time was a wake-up call: I need to take care of myself for real. I can’t train like I used to, so it’ll be slower, but I still want to return as close as possible to my old condition. I love doing 100-day projects, so I decided to start a new one: a 100-day recovery / rehab / fat-loss project.

Later in the week, I felt a cold coming on in the evening—maybe I pushed too hard, or maybe my immunity dipped temporarily. I especially felt a lot of heat in my ears, which made me worry it could be the flu. I stopped working, read for a while, drank a vitamin drink, took cold medicine, and went to bed. I kept waking up during the night because my ears felt hot, but luckily I felt much better by morning. Still, I didn’t want to take chances, so I went to the clinic and got a flu shot.

This month, I also started a new freelance development job. I reconnected with someone from my previous company, and I’m taking charge of the development side in a setup that’s almost like outsourcing. He'll handle promotion/marketing/content, and I can focus purely on building. Since the project is quite large, I hit the usage limits on my Claude Code Pro plan quickly. It was more than enough for my personal projects, but with a bigger context, the ceiling shows up fast. Thankfully, he gifted me a Claude Code Max x5 plan, which helped me move faster. It was fun to work with the kind of steady focus I used to have at a company, and using Claude Code like a teammate made it easier to understand the project more deeply.

Still, I feel like I’m not using Claude Code to its full potential yet. When I see other developers running two or three projects at once with AI coding agents, it’s impressive—and sometimes it makes me feel behind. It really feels like we’re entering an era where we need to study not only “programming,” but also how to work with AI effectively. This year, I want to prepare and get more intentional about it.

I also started a YouTube channel. I’ve always loved documenting things, and I’ve had this vague thought for a while: what if I didn’t stop at writing, and also left my records as video? This year, I wanted to try something new, so I finally started. I want to document what I’m building, and capture small pieces of daily life too. My goal is to upload once or twice a month.

The week went by so quickly. Next week, I’ll be moving to a different place and will have more time alone—so I want to make good use of it.
