## Two Months Post-Surgery
It's been two months since my left arm surgery. I've been diligently attending manual therapy sessions, and I can finally bend my arm to about 120 degrees. Now I'm also focusing on arm extension exercises using a foam roller and towel. When gripping the towel or holding the foam roller with my left hand, I struggle to apply proper force or rotate. Arm rotation is especially painful. I need to gradually work on flexion, extension, and rotation exercises evenly.

I've been consistently applying ointment to the surgical site, and the stitches are starting to surface. As the muscles heal, the stitches are coming up, so I'm removing them as they emerge. A few still remain, so I'll remove the rest as they surface. However, I've developed slight skin inflammation, so I got a prescription for inflammation cream. I was wearing a brace when going out just to be safe, but the prolonged compression seems to be causing it. Next time, I'll be more careful without wearing the brace.

When I wrote my last blog post, I used an iPad and Apple Pencil, but now that I can type a bit, I wrote this post using keyboard typing for the first time in a while.

## The App

I launched v1.1. I added features including Reminders support, upcoming events widget, and monthly calendar widget. I lowered the price to $1.99 and promoted it on the r/iosapps community as well, which received an excellent response. The Reddit post reached 23,000 views with a 97.6% positive response rate. In the first 7 days after launch, I achieved 73 sales and $104 in revenue. I received lots of feedback through comments, and as expected, people requested the ability to open events in other calendar apps, so I decided to add this feature in the next app version.

However, sales spiked right after posting on Reddit and then dropped as time passed. To achieve sustained sales, I need ASO along with consistent marketing, not just a single post.

## What I Learned
I learned several things through this launch. Reddit posts only get good responses for 2-3 days and then drop sharply. So I can't rely on just one post. I also learned that price experimentation is important. At $0.99, I had 29 sales, but at $1.99, I had 73 sales, confirming that a higher price can actually bring more revenue. Most importantly, I felt firsthand how crucial it is to add features that people genuinely need.

## Future Plans
As I plan the v1.2 update, I've decided to invest more time in rehabilitation. Reducing my computer time has definitely started to accelerate my recovery speed. For ASO, I'll start with keyword optimization and improving the App Store description, and I plan to collect user reviews to build credibility. I need to gradually shift my strategy to generate consistent sales.

It's amazing and rewarding to see sales happening while developing with one hand. I still have a long way to go, but I believe that if I keep at it consistently, I'll eventually achieve stable revenue.
